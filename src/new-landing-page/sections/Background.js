          11:04 PM It is incumbent for every university that they serve as a
          centre for knowledge creation and dissemination. Universities should
          play a pivotal role in creating a conscious and perceptive society.
          There is no other option but to do good research to achieve this goal.
          University is that place of research where new ideas will be born and
          here lies the difference between the schools with university
          graduates. There is a given syllabus in secondary schools and higher
          secondary colleges and they study and do practicals based on that
          syllabus. On the other hand in university one can understand the basic
          knowledge along with how that knowledge is being applied in different
          aspects of our lives in the form of research. Moreover, it encourages
          how to enhance this knowledge, create a new dimension of that
          knowledge and get the most out of this research. But it is also a
          bitter truth that where the world is moving so fast many of the
          Universities in Bangladesh are going in their conventional ways.
          Students are researching in their final years only to pass but doing
          research passionately from 1st or 2nd year is very rare in our
          country.<br></br>
          This group was founded with a noble purpose for a research
          devoted environment in the Universities and Colleges in Bangladesh.
          Though it is observed that the students of the final year do their
          thesis for obtaining the certificate only whereas it could be any
          student from any year. And it has been shown by Mr. Md. Sabir Hossain
          who is currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department
          of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE), Chittagong University of
          Engineering & Technology (CUET), Bangladesh. The Students from 2nd
          Year in the department of CSE, CUET have published more than 10
          articles in international conferences and journals. This type of
          accomplishment is rare not only in Bangladesh but also in first world
          universities. Being perplexed by this achievement he has created a
          social media-based platform named Be Researcher BD (গবেষক হতে চাই) to
          diverge this enthusiasm among all of the students who are pursuing
          higher degrees. Moreover, this group is directed and guided by some
          world class visionary researchers and academicians. Among many
          difficulties in fundings and recognition, they dream of a
          research-friendly environment in higher educational institutes. Be
          Researcher BD group is assisting research enthusiast learners with
          different activities.
