          It is incumbent for every university that they serve as a centre for
          knowledge creation and dissemination. Universities should play a
          pivotal role in creating a conscious and perceptive society. There is
          no other option but to do good research to achieve this goal.
          University is that place of research where new ideas will be born and
          here lies the difference between the schools with university
          graduates. There is a given syllabus in secondary schools and higher
          secondary colleges and they study and do practicals based on that
          syllabus. On the other hand in university one can understand the basic
          knowledge along with how that knowledge is being applied in different
          aspects of our lives in the form of research. Moreover, it encourages
          how to enhance this knowledge, create a new dimension of that
          knowledge and get the most out of this research. But it is also a
          bitter truth that where the world is moving so fast many of the
          Universities in Bangladesh are going in their conventional ways.
          Students are researching in their final years only to pass but doing
          research passionately from 1st or 2nd year is very rare in our
          country.{' '}
